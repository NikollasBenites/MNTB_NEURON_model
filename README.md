# 🧠 MNTB Principal Neuron Model – NEURON Simulation (Python)

This repository contains a NEURON-based simulation of principal neurons in the Medial Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body (MNTB), developed for understanding intrinsic properties and responses across development. The model is built using Python and `.mod` files, and analyzed with matplotlib, scipy, and numpy.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NikollasBenites/MNTB_NEURON_model.git
cd MNTB_NEURON_model
```
### 2. Create the Conda Environment
``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate neuron_env
```
### 3. Compile NEURON Mechanisms

Make sure you're in the root project directory (Mac and Windows) using Terminal:

```bash
nrnivmodl mod/
```
This will generate the arm64/ folder with compiled special (in Mac).
In Windows OS you will generate a file nrnmech.dll in the Root.

### 4. Run a Simulation
Via terminal:
```bash
python mod/MNTB_PN_simulation_code.py
```
Or in PyCharm:

    Open the project
    Ensure interpreter = neuron_env
    Use the Run Simulation config

# 👥 Collaboration Workflow
🧪 Recommended Git Practice
## Before working
```bash
git pull origin main
```
## After making changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin main
```
Use branches for feature development or testing:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-analysis
```

📦 Reproducing the Environment
If the environment ever changes:
``` bash
conda env export --no-builds | grep -v "prefix:" > environment.yml
git commit -am "Update environment with new packages"
git push
```
